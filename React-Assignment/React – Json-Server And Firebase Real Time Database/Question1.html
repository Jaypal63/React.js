    <h1>What do you mean by RESTful web services?</h1>
    <h2>Ans:</h2>

    <p>
        <li>RESTful web services are web services that adhere to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), an architectural style for designing networked applications.</li>
        <li>RESTful services enable communication between systems using standard HTTP methods and are designed to be stateless, scalable, and flexible.</li>
        <li>Resource-Based: Resources, such as data or objects, are identified by unique URLs. For example, a resource representing a user might be accessible at https://example.com/users/123.</li>
        <li>Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the necessary information for the server to process the request. The server does not store session information about the client.</li>
        <li>Representation: Resources can be represented in different formats, such as JSON, XML, or HTML, depending on the client's requirements.</li>
        <li>Stateless Communication: Each client request is independent, and the server does not retain information about previous requests.</li>
